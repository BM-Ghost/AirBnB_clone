### Airbnb Clone

#### Overview
> This repository constitutes a segment of the Airbnb clone project, focusing on the HTML and CSS implementation. Within the repository, the Images directory contains various icons essential for the site's visual elements such as logos, bathroom symbols, bedroom symbols, and guest symbols. The Styles directory houses CSS files responsible for styling the webpages. Among these files, the one with the highest numerical designation within each category (e.g., common, footer, header, places) holds the most relevance to the finalized design. Similarly, the index.html file with the highest numerical suffix is pivotal in representing the completed product.
